//! Control flow graph analysis for EVM bytecode
//!
//! This module provides types and structures for representing control flow graphs of EVM bytecode.
//! It is primarily used internally by the analyzer and should not be used directly.
//!
//! To analyze EVM bytecode and get its control flow graph, use the [`super::contract_info`]
//! function instead. This module is exported only to make its types and structures available
//! for use with the public API.
